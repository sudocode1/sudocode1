# sudocode1
PHP and JavaScript dev. I do some C++ occaisonally as well, but I'm not good at it. <br>

Most of my major projects are private and unfinished. If you're interested in taking a look (i.e. for the purpose of looking at previous work), feel free to ask! Most of my public repos are old and/or meme projects.
