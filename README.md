# sudocode1
PHP and JavaScript developer.<br>
I do use some other languages occasionally as well, but I'm not very good at them.<br>
I am currently learning Go.

Most of my major projects are private and/or unfinished. If you're interested in taking a look (i.e. for the purpose of looking at previous work), feel free to ask! Most of my public repos are old and/or meme projects.
